## CL-P7FIX — test_phase7.py Fix: CSRF + Unicode + pytest Collection
**Completed:** 07-20-25 02:30:00 UTC

### Root Cause
`tests/test_phase7.py` was a standalone test script (68 checks) that had 3 compounding bugs:
1. **Missing `WTF_CSRF_ENABLED = False`** — all POST routes returned 500 because Flask-WTF CSRF protection rejected requests without tokens. This caused 7 test failures (pin, bookmark, patient-gen, what's-new APIs).
2. **Unicode arrow character `→` (U+2192)** — not representable in Windows cp1252 encoding when piped to file. Crashed the `ok()` print function, turning 4 PASSes into ERRORs.
3. **No `if __name__ == '__main__':` guard** — `sys.exit(1)` at module level killed pytest's collection phase, blocking **all** pytest tests from running.

### Fixes Applied
- Added `app.config['WTF_CSRF_ENABLED'] = False` to test setup
- Replaced `→` with `->` (17 occurrences) and `⏱️` with `[timer]`
- Created `tests/conftest.py` with `collect_ignore = ['test_phase7.py']` to exclude standalone script from pytest collection

### Result
- `test_phase7.py`: 68/68 passed, 0 failed, 0 errors (was: 41 passed, 7 failed, 3 errors)
- pytest collection: no longer crashes on import

### Files Modified
- `tests/test_phase7.py` — CSRF config + Unicode fixes
- `tests/conftest.py` — NEW, pytest collection exclusion

## CL-TEAM — Full Product Team Governance System
**Completed:** 03-22-26 15:30:00 UTC

### Copilot-Instructions Expanded (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
- **Identity & Role rewritten** — Copilot is now the entire product team (CTO, PM, Product Owner, QA Lead, Security Officer, DevOps, Risk Manager) with responsibility table.
- **6 new governance sections added:**
  - SaaS-Ready Development Rules — dual-mode mandate, desktop isolation, adapter-first, query scoping, SQLite→PostgreSQL path
  - Product Thinking — feature-to-tier mapping, UX quality gate (5 checks), MVP discipline, "who pays?" test
  - QA Discipline — test-with-every-feature rule, regression check protocol, test naming convention
  - Security & Compliance — HIPAA scanning every session, auth pattern enforcement, dependency hygiene
  - Risk Register Protocol — maintained in PROJECT_STATUS.md, top 3 surfaced at session start, 4 risk categories
  - Strategic Decision Log — SD-xxx entries in CHANGE_LOG.md with context/decision/rationale/consequences format
- **Session Workflow upgraded** — now includes Risk Register check, HIPAA scan, and risk surfacing at session start.

### CareCompanion Agent (`.github/agents/CareCompanion.agent.md`)
- **Full rewrite from boilerplate** — autonomous agent with audit→plan→execute autopilot protocol.
- 4-phase mandatory workflow: Audit (7 steps) → Plan (6 steps) → Execute (5 steps) → Finalize (6 steps).
- "Plan only" override for when user wants review before execution.
- Tool access: vscode, execute, read, agent, edit, search, web, todo.

### Slash Commands Created (`.github/prompts/`)
- `/sprint-review` — PM: audit progress, verify Feature Registry, plan next steps
- `/security-audit` — Security: HIPAA + OWASP scan, auth gaps, dependency CVEs
- `/saas-check` — CTO: desktop boundary, tenant isolation, DB portability audit
- `/tech-debt` — CTO: dead code, duplication, pattern violations, coverage gaps
- `/test-plan` — QA: generate test plan for any feature/module
- `/risk-report` — Risk Manager: review/update Risk Register, assess blockers

### File-Scoped Instructions Created (`.github/instructions/`)
- `models.instructions.md` — soft-delete, user_id scoping, timestamps, exports
- `routes.instructions.md` — @login_required, JSON format, error handling, HIPAA
- `agent-boundary.instructions.md` — desktop-only imports, OCR-first, error handling
- `adapters.instructions.md` — BaseAdapter pattern, EHR-agnostic data, no desktop imports

### Other Files
- `.github/COMMANDS.md` — quick reference for all commands, agents, and auto-instructions
- `Documents/dev_guide/PROJECT_STATUS.md` — Risk Register added (R1–R7, 7 initial risks)

### File Count
- 14 files created/modified
- 0 files deleted

---

## CL-PM — Copilot Project Manager Upgrade
**Completed:** 03-22-26 UTC

### Changes to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Identity rewritten** — Copilot is now explicitly the project manager AND coder. Owns organization, discipline, and long-term codebase health.
- **Added "Project Manager Discipline" section** — Anti-sprawl enforcement (search before create, propose append, challenge multi-file creation), proactive cleanup duties, code quality gate checklist.
- **Workflow Rules strengthened** — Changelog/registry updates are mandatory after every code-changing prompt, not optional housekeeping. Timestamped format required (`MM-DD-YY HH:MM:SS UTC`).
- **Session Workflow hardened** — Start-of-session now scans for stale/orphaned issues. End-of-session updates are non-skippable. Added mid-session discipline (immediate changelog, pivot tracking, pattern detection).
- **Graduation Workflow** — Now explicitly automatic and timestamped when features complete.
- **Feature Registry** — Added "Completed Feature → Changelog Migration" template with exact format for entries.
- **Pushback behavior codified** — Copilot must resist unnecessary file creation and offer alternatives. Will comply if overruled but flags for future consolidation.

## What Was NOT Done (Deferred / Requires Human Action)

### Systems 3–4 (Phase 3): Split View + Picture-in-Picture Widgets

**Why not implemented:**
- **Split View** (Steps 27-30) requires either: (a) iframes for full page isolation, creating session token issues with Flask-Login; or (b) server-side AJAX-rendered page fragments, requiring all 28+ routes to support a `?fragment=1` render mode. Neither is safe to implement without architectural decisions from the developer.
- **PiP Widgets** (Steps 31-34) requires cloning live DOM widgets and keeping them synchronized with page navigation. The existing `free_widgets.js` system uses a different persistence model. The pop-out/clone pattern needs the developer to audit which widgets are safe to clone (some fetch live data, others are Jinja-rendered once).

**What you need to do:**
1. Decide on Split View approach: iframe-based (simpler but same-origin required) or fragment-based (cleaner but requires route changes)
2. Add `data-pip="true"` and `data-pip-title="..."` to eligible patient chart widgets after reviewing which ones are safe to detach
3. Implement `PipManager` JS class — can follow the drag/resize pattern from `free_widgets.js`

### System 5 (Phase 2A): Smart Bookmarks Folders

**Why not implemented:**
- Existing bookmarks system (`/api/bookmarks/personal`) stores flat JSON arrays. Adding folder support requires a migration that changes the data schema. The developer should back up bookmark data before running.
- Drag-to-bookmark requires `draggable="true"` on all `<a>` elements, which may interfere with existing drag behaviors in order sets and free widgets.

**What you need to do:**
1. Run a migration for the bookmarks schema: wrap existing flat entries in `{ type: 'link', ... }` objects
2. Update `/api/bookmarks/personal` POST handler to accept folder-type entries
3. Implement drag-to-bookmark JS in `base.html` (Steps 36-37)

### System 9 (Phase 4B/4C): AI Enhancements

**Why not implemented:**
- AI writing assistant (Step 53-55) requires user API key management. The current AI panel uses a shared key from `config.py`. Per-user API keys need a new model field, an encrypted storage strategy (not plaintext in DB), and rate-limit tracking per user.
- Help popovers (Steps 56-58) require `help_guide.json` to have entries for all 9 new Phase 44 systems. The current file covers Phases 1-43.

**What you need to do:**
1. Add `ai_api_key` field to `User` model (store encrypted, decrypt at request time)
2. Add per-user `ai_rate_limit_hourly` and `ai_rate_limit_daily` preference keys to settings page
3. Add Phase 44 system entries to `data/help_guide.json`
4. Implement `.ai-assist-icon` placement on textareas/contenteditable fields

**Files Changed:** 20+ templates, main.css, base.html, auth.py, settings.html, admin_users.html

**Previously Implemented (Discovered on Audit):** Systems 1 (Context Sub-Panel CSS + JS), 2 (Popup Taskbar), 6 (Breadcrumb Trail), 7 (Type-Ahead Filter), 8 (Page Transitions) — all CSS foundations and base.html containers were already in place.

**Implemented This Bite:**
- Step 26: `data-blocking="true"` on 4 security modals (hipaa, lock, p1, deactivation)
- Phase 1C: Sub-panels on all 15 non-dashboard page templates
- Step 46: `data-filterable` attribute on 13 list templates
- Step 43: `data-breadcrumb-badge` on 4 pages (patient_chart, caregap, inbox, timer)
- Step 49: Page transitions settings UI (5 presets, API persist, server→localStorage sync)
- Bonus: `page_id` block on staff_billing_tasks.html

**Tests Created:** test_subpanel (18), test_popup_taskbar (10), test_breadcrumbs (10), test_type_ahead (16), test_transitions (12) — all passing.

**Deferred:** System 3 (Split View), System 4 (PiP), System 5 (Smart Bookmarks), System 9 (AI Enhancements)

### Bite 2 — Phase 44 Continuation (Systems 3, 4, 5, 9D)

**Files Changed:** base.html, main.css, auth.py, help.py, settings.html, patient_chart.html, labtrack.html, caregap.html, timer.html, notifications.html, help_guide.json

**Implemented:**
- System 3 (Split View): CSS, SplitViewManager JS, Ctrl+click interceptor, settings pane-count UI, API endpoint
- System 4 (PiP Widgets): CSS, PipManager JS, data-pip on patient_chart (21 widgets) + 4 additional templates
- System 5 (Smart Bookmarks with Folders): CSS, drag-to-bookmark JS, folder API endpoints, schema migration
- System 9D (Help Popovers): CSS, help-icon/popover elements, __npHelp preload, /api/help/items, 8 Phase 44 entries in help_guide.json

**Tests Created:** test_split_view (19), test_pip_widgets (20), test_bookmarks_folders (19), test_ai_enhancements (20) — all passing.

**Deferred:** System 9A (AI Workflow Coach), 9B (AI Natural Language Nav), 9C (AI Writing Assistant) — require encrypted API key storage.
